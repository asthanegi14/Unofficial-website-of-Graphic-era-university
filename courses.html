                    destinies of human beings. Three divisions of Jyotish are Siddhant, Hora and Samhita. Our course is
                    mainly focused on “Hora”. Past deeds and predestination have a definite role to play. Astrology is a
                    divine science which is based on Astronomical and mathematical calculations. Hence, it is only
                    through the study of Vedic Astrology the secret of fate and free will can be deciphered.</p>
